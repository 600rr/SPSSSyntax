### Matching Files

Match files is an SPSS command that's mostly used for merging data holding the same cases but different variables.

The most common scenario for MATCH FILES are two data files or datasets holding different variables on similar cases.

Each case has a unique id (identifier) in each data source. This id tells SPSS which case from one data source corresponds to which case from the other. Corresponding cases become a single case in the merged data.
